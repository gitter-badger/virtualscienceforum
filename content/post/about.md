### What is a virtual conference?
Scientific conferences often require traveling to other parts of the world.
Modern technology, however, enables us to host virtual conferences with thousands
of viewers and hundreds of interacting participants.

Hosting a virtual conference has multiple benefits:

* Reduction in CO2 emission due to elimination of travel
* Enabling participants who are otherwise constrained (family) to participate
* Trying changes to make this thing work.
* Another change and commit

### The conference theme

This conference is titled "The very first virtual conference on [subject]".
We will have invited speakers, and moderators who take care of the interaction
between the speaker and the audience.
